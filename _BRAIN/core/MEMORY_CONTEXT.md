## 🎯 Purpose & Context

Kemal is developing and implementing a spiritual/personal development system called **"OLUK MEGA SİSTEM"** - a structured 40-day practice protocol that combines traditional spiritual elements with a distinctive modern aesthetic. The system appears to be designed as a comprehensive personal transformation methodology that integrates meditation, visualization, breathwork, and journaling into organized lesson formats.

The work involves creating content in a unique **"Osmanlı Cyberpunk"** (Ottoman Cyberpunk) writing style that blends mystical/spiritual language with contemporary formatting and presentation. This aesthetic requires specific linguistic approaches including short, impactful sentences and avoidance of conventional spiritual clichés.

## 📊 Current State

Kemal is actively working on **Lesson 2** of the OLUK system, specifically developing **"Yasin Kapısı"** (Yasin Gate) sessions. The current focus involves adapting traditional spiritual practices into the OLUK methodology's distinctive format and presentation style.

## 🎨 Approach & Patterns

The OLUK system follows a highly structured organizational framework with **five core columns:**

1. **Inventory** (Envanter)
2. **Diagnosis** (Teşhis)
3. **Protocol** (Protokol)
4. **Knowledge Bank** (Bilgi Bankası)
5. **Security** (Güvenlik)

### 📚 Lesson Structure

Each lesson is designed as a **four-phase practice session:**

1. **Preparation (Uyumlama)** - Hazırlık
2. **Purification (Arınma)** - Temizlik
3. **Activation (Aktivasyon)** - Etkinleştirme
4. **Integration (Entegrasyon)** - Bütünleştirme

**Features:**
